### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - Smartphones data reveal which Americans are Social Distancing (and not)

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/24/social-distancing-maps-cellphone-location/

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - This article looks at two different data companies using data location. The first
 company was Unacast, which collects and analyzes phone gps location. They use
 this to look county by county in the United States to see who is reducing movement
 as to follow covid protocols. The other company a group called Ghost Data and a
 firm called Logo Grab used location data and image analyses. They used instagram
 to track Italians who are not following the stay at home policy. This showed
 things like 40 percent of Italians not following the rules and 26 percent were
 found at the beach.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern here is the data being used to track people and they may
 not be aware of it. This is being done by Unacast is being used to see how people
 are moving during the coronavirus to see if movement has been reduced. However,
 this data can also be used to track people. The ethical concern is that this data
 can be sold to other data firms that use it to take advantage of people. What if
 this data gets sold to companies that use it to take advantage of people. In the
 article, it talks about the company collected it data's from different apps, but
 declines to comment on what apps. The concern comes to what else this data is
 being used for. For some people this is a breach of privacy especially during a
 pandemic, were someone may be going to hospital for a private matter, like having
 coivd, and the data shows them being at this location which could cause some
 people to find out when they don't want anyone to know. In Italy they have a stay
 a home policy, but find out that 40 percent of the population isn't following
 this could cause them to use this data to punish the people.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated is peoples location.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Unacast analyzes phone gps location. Unacastâ€™s location data comes from games,
 shopping and utility apps that ask to use your current location. When selected
 to use current location while on app, this data gets sent to Unacast.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The people that stand to gain the most from this form of analysis is retailers,
 real estate firms, marketers, and side vendors. They can use this data to find
 the best location to place their stores where they run into the most traffic.
 This allows them to give themselves the best chance to do business and create sales.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - How Businesses Are Collecting Data (And What They're Doing With It)

-  Reference or article citation.
 - https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10625-businesses-collecting-data.html

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article looks into the types of data consumer businesses collect. They list
 four known as personal, engagement, behavioral, and attitudinal. Personal data
 includes information such as Social Security numbers and gender as well as
 nonpersonally identifiable information, including your IP address, and
 web browser cookies. Engagement data includes how consumers interact with a
 business's website, mobile apps, social media pages, emails, paid ads and
 customer service routes. Behavioral includes things like purchase history and
 attitudinal is used for customer satisfaction and product desirability. The article
 then goes on to discuss collecting data, turn it into knowledge, and then use
 the data. Data is collected by directly asking customers, by indirectly
 tracking customers, and by appending other sources of customer data to your own.
 The data is collected to improve customer experience, change companies marketing
 strategy, data into cash flow, and get more data.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The ethical concern is when companies sell personal information and other
 data to third-party sources. This causes personal information like location to be
 spread all over the place and this is where the data can be misused.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - location-based advertising, which utilizes tracking technologies such as an
 internet-connected device's IP address. The article also talks about personal data
 like Social Security numbers and gender as well as. Some other data collected is
 details such as purchase histories and product usage information. This is just
 some of the data that can be manipulated.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - This article does not give specific analysis of the data but talks about that
 data can become so big that a computer is required and the best method to do this
 is machine learning. As machine learning algorithms and other forms of AI
 proliferate and improve, data analytics becomes an even more powerful field for
 breaking down the sea of data into manageable tidbits of actionable insights. Some
 AI programs will flag anomalies or offer recommendations to decision-makers within
 an organization based on the contextualized data.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Companies stand to gain from using these types of data. Segmenting data effectively
 allows you to market to only the people you know are most likely to engage. These
 have opened up new opportunities in industries that were previously very hard to market.
 This gives them more opportunities to create business. Companies also gain by
 making money from collecting data and selling it to other businesses. People can
 lose in the sense of spam of emails from things they did not sign up for along
 with personal data being shared.
